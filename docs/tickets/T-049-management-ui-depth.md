# T-049 — Management UI depth (finance graph, staff fire/patrol, per-ride upgrade panel)

- **Priority**: 🟡 Feature
- **Type**: UI / gameplay
- **Status**: ✅ Core done
- **Parents**: [T-042](T-042-economy-controls-loans.md), [T-043](T-043-staff-management.md),
  [T-044](T-044-research-upgrades.md). **Builds on**: [T-041](T-041-ride-shop-placement.md) (HudPanel/UI).

## Context

The economy, staff and research systems are all **core done** and driven from real data, but their
player-facing UI is still keyboard/HUD-text only. This ticket finishes the clickable panels.

## Scope

1. **Finance** (T-042 tail): a clickable economy panel with an income/expense **graph** over time, and
   per-ride price controls (beyond the global admission/price keys).
2. **Staff** (T-043 tail): **fire** a staff member from the UI, and assign **patrol zones** (handymen/
   guards already patrol toward litter/unhappy peeps — let the player bound the area).
3. **Research** (T-044 tail): a **per-ride upgrade/research panel** — pick what to research, see
   `Upgrades[*]` progress and apply capacity/other bumps per ride (the data + effects already exist).

## Acceptance criteria

- The player can, by mouse: read a finance graph + set a ride's price; fire a staffer + set a patrol
  zone; and drive research / apply an upgrade from a panel — each verified in-game.

## What was done

1. **Finance graph** — `ParkFinances` now keeps a rolling per-month history
   (`History`: `(Balance, Income, Expense)` sampled in `Tick`, capped at `MaxHistory = 48`). New
   `FinancePanel` (**F11**) plots the income (green) / expense (red) bars over time with the current
   balance + cumulative totals. History sampling is unit-tested (`ManagementDepthTests`).
2. **Per-ride price** — already clickable in `ManagePanel` (`PRICE-`/`PRICE+` on the selected-ride row,
   from T-042); left as-is.
3. **Staff fire + patrol zones** — `Staff.Fire()` cleanly removes the staffer + its shadow + guard
   registration; a new pure `PatrolZone(center, radius)` bounds wandering **and** job-seeking (a zoned
   guard ignores trouble outside its area; a zoned handyman only clears litter inside it). `BuildMode`
   selects the nearest staffer to a Default-tool click (`SelectedStaff`) and exposes fire / set-zone-here
   / grow-shrink / free-roam; `ManagePanel` shows a **FIRE / ZONE± / SET-ZONE / FREE-ROAM** row and
   `ParkStatsPanel` a status line. `PatrolZone` containment is unit-tested.
4. **Per-ride research/upgrade** — already a clickable gauge/button in `ManagePanel` (`RESEARCH`/`UPGRADE`
   with a live progress bar, from T-044); left as-is.

In-park mouse verification (clicking a staffer, dragging the graph open) is display-blocked like the other
recent UI tickets; the new model logic (`ParkFinances.History`, `PatrolZone`) is unit-tested, and the UI
reuses the verified `HudPanel` click/hit-test path.

## Remaining (nice-to-have)

- A draggable patrol-zone (currently anchored at the staffer's position with ± radius), and a zone
  highlight ring in the world.
- A dedicated per-ride panel window (the controls live on the shared `ManagePanel` bar today).
