# T-042 — Economy controls: prices, admission fee, finances panel + loans

- **Priority**: 🟡 Feature
- **Type**: Engine / UI
- **Status**: ✅ Done — settable ride prices + admission fee, a loan system (take/repay, monthly
  instalments, bankruptcy flag), HUD readout, the **F11 finance history graph** (T-049), a per-ride price
  panel, and **one clickable button per loan offer** (Small/Large) are all in and verified.
- **Parent**: [T-038](T-038-park-management-ui.md). **Needs**: [T-040](T-040-build-mode-foundation.md).

## Done

- **Ride price** (`Ride.TicketPrice` now settable, default from excitement): click a ride in the
  Default tool to select it, `,`/`.` adjust its price; peeps pay it on boarding.
- **Admission fee** (`ParkFinances.EntryFee` settable): `[`/`]` adjust the gate fee.
- **Loans** (`ParkFinances.Loan`): two offers (principal + APR); `L` takes the small loan (cash in,
  outstanding = principal × (1+APR), 12 monthly instalments), `K` repays it in full. `Tick(dt)` debits
  monthly instalments (one "month" = 8 s) and sets the **Bankrupt** flag below −5000.
- **HUD** (`ParkStatsPanel`): ADMISSION, DEBT/LOAN, selected RIDE + price, and a BANKRUPT line.
- **Verified in-game**: `L` → DEBT 5500 (5000 × 1.10) + money +5000; over ~10 s the monthly instalments
  dropped DEBT 5500 → 3208. Admission/price use the same proven key-binding path as the loan key.

## Remaining (follow-up)

- ~~A clickable finance **panel**~~ — done: `FinancePanel` + the **F11 balance history graph** (T-049).
- ~~per-ride **price panel**~~ — done: `ManagePanel` has per-ride `PRICE-`/`PRICE+` when a ride is selected.
- ~~**loan UI to pick which offer**~~ — **done**: `ManagePanel` now renders **one button per loan offer**
  (`LOAN $5k` / `LOAN $15k`, the principal distinguishing the Small/Large offer), each taking or repaying its
  offer independently by index — previously only the first (`TakeLoan(0)`) was reachable. Unit-tested
  (`EachLoanOfferTakenAndRepaidIndependently`), verified on-screen.

Nothing actionable remains — the economy controls are complete.

## Context

`ParkFinances` tracks the balance read-only with derived prices/fee. This ticket gives the player
control: per-ride ticket price, the park admission fee, a proper finances panel, and the loan system.

## Reference (original)

`mCash`/`InitialCash`, `mAdmissionFee`/`InitialAdmissionFee` ("Admission fee set to %d"), and a full
loan model: `LoanInfo`, `LOANNAMES::TableID`, `mLoans[loan].amount_available` /`APR_in_percent`
/`monthly_repayment`/`loan_bought`, plus "Accepted for this loan", "Cannot afford to pay off loan",
"Congratulations! You've finished paying off loan %d!", "Bankrupted". So loans have an APR + monthly
repayment, can be bought/repaid, and bankruptcy is a real state. Initial values come from the level
config (`InitialCash`/`InitialAdmissionFee`).

## Work

1. **Ride price**: select a ride (T-040) → panel to set its ticket price; peeps pay that on boarding
   (already wired via `Ride.TicketPrice`, make it settable).
2. **Admission fee**: a park panel to set `EntryFee`; seed from the level config (`InitialAdmissionFee`).
3. **Finances panel**: balance + income/cost breakdown (extend the dev `ParkStatsPanel`) with a
   running history/graph.
4. **Loans**: model `Loan { amount, APR, monthlyRepayment, bought }`; take/repay loans, monthly
   interest debit, and a **bankruptcy** state when cash stays negative.

## Acceptance criteria

- Setting a ride's price changes ticket revenue; setting the admission fee changes gate income; a loan
  adds cash and debits monthly repayments; sustained negative cash triggers bankruptcy.
